This repository contains implementations of the following results:
1. The valuation of European options in the presence of discrete and proportional dividends, assuming that the underlying follows a Black-Scholes process with deterministic volatility between ex-dividend dates. In this case, the valuation can be efficiently performed with the result of Gocsei and Sohel. For general local volatility processes, including the Black-Scholes model, the valuation can also be carried out by solving backward and forward PDEs.
2. The calibration of local volatility models with a bootstrapping procedure, utilizing the forward PDE method for European option valuation. With this method, local volatility functions can still be obtained even in the presence of dividends.
3. The calibration of Andersen-Buffum convertible bond model and also the valuation of convertible bonds using this model. The Andersen-Buffum procedure is extended to match the whole equity volatility surface, and is not just limited to ATM volatilities.
4. Various flavors of SABR and CEV models, including the shifted and free boundary versions, and their calibration.
